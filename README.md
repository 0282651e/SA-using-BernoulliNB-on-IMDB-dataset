# SA-using-BernoulliNB-on-IMDB-dataset
Simple python project for Binary sentiment classification using Naive Bayes. For now, it is just a python script.It has an 
accuracy of 83% on IMDB dataset classification. The script can be used in movie reviews websites in order to classify the 
sentiment of the user reviews, that is either the review is positive or negative one.

SA.py file contains the training code. Once trained, the model is saved into the file "model.pickle". Input.py uses this saved model to predict the sentiment of the new user input.
